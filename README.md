# Road to healing
**Road to Healing** is **a VR adventure serious game** utilizing alternate input methods, designed to assist players in rehabilitation exercises. Players perform targeted leg movements, with sensor signals analyzed and transmitted to the game, immersing them in a beautifully crafted world filled with interactive puzzles. This project combines VR gaming with motion sensor technology to create a training and instructional solution for VTE leg rehabilitation exercises. It helps players engage in rehabilitation workouts and includes conducting a series of structured experiments to assess its effectiveness.
