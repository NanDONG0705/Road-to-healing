# Readme

The folder contains three files: fyp, fyp_needcompile, and IMU. The fyp file can be directly opened and run, but there might be a risk of file corruption when copying it to a personal computer. In such cases, you can use fyp_needcompile, which requires more time to open and additional configuration. The IMU file contains code related to the sensors.
